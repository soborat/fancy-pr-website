              Google and social media verification we cannot guarantee either of
              these as they are both out of our control. Therefore we cannot

              guarantee that your articles or website will appear on the first

          Writing
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Our team will research your brand and write a press release article
          based on the links and information you provide us when placing your
          order. This article will meet the minimum word count for your chosen
          plan or package and will contain link(s) to the website you provided.
          We will always send you the article to review and request changes
          before we publish it.

          Publishing
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Our team will publish the article you approve (or send us) on a
          minimum of 200 websites.
          <br />
          If an article cannot be published, you will have the option of
          receiving a refund, or have the opportunity to rewrite the article, or
          request our team rewrite it if your order included our writing
          service.
          <br />
          Once an article is published, there is no way for us to change it. We
          assume no liability for any inaccuracies in the publications caused by
          any party, including us, the individual news sites, our publication
          partners, and our clients. We cannot be held responsible for any

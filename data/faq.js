      question: "How long will the article be live?",
      answer: `The news sites we work with usually keep articles live for 3-24 months. For the best SEO results, we recommend ordering at least once a month.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will all the backlinks be do-follow",
      answer: `Most of the larger news sites tend to publish no-follow links, while smaller news sites are more likely to using do-follow links.
      <br /><br />
      We do get lots of clients who initially are concerned about nofollow links. But after seeing how these links still positively affect their search position, they are usually happy to continue ordering monthly. In most cases, our clients notice a boost within the first month of receiving their report.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I promote affiliate products?",
      answer: `Yes, you can promote affiliate links. We cannot include direct affiliate links within the article itself, so you should have a landing page containing your affiliate link.`,

    {
      question: "How do I get verified on social media?",
      answer: `We have helped many people and brands get verified on social media.
      <br /><br />
      Social media sites require you to provide news articles to prove that you are a person of interest or notable.
      <br /><br />
      To help you in this process, we can write and publish a news story about your brand on more than 200 news sites with live links so you can give social media sites the proof they need.
      <br /><br />
      It's important to understand that social media sites consider many factors during the verification process, so our service cannot guarantee verification. But we can give you the edge you need in the verification process.
      <br /><br />
      When applying for verification, you should ensure your profile is complete and has been active for some time. Only use links to publications like Digital Journal, AZ Central, and Daily Herald that don't use "sponsored content" labels. And finally, make sure your account is secured with multi-factor authentication.
      <br /><br />
      Don't stress if your application is rejected. Just apply again after six months with a few extra publications.`,

    {
      question: "Will I get more website visitors?",
      answer: `Our publications are excellent at delivering highly motivated visitors to your website for years to come. The publications often rank on the first page of Google for relevant search terms to advertise you to thousands of interested readers and warm them up to your brand and offer before they reach your site, ready to take action.
      <br /><br />
      Getting published on many high-authority news sites also helps boost your own site's position on Google delivering even more traffic to your site from Google without even having to read a single publication.
      <br /><br />
      Not to mention the additional publicity and awareness brought to everyone who reads our publications or sees them on Google. Such exposure is excellent for driving direct traffic to your site.`,

    <br /><br />
    <ul><li>A topic for the article</li>
    <li>A link to your website</li>
    <li>Your business contact details</li></ul>
    We also accept images, quotes and can even embed YouTube videos within the article.
    
    To get started, order either our Premium or Elite Plans.`,

      question: "What should my article be about?",
      answer: `Your article can be just a general announcement of your business, talking about your features and benefits.
      <br /><br />
      It can be any newsworthy topic, such as a new product or service you just launched.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I edit an article after it's published?",
      answer: `No, once an article is live, we cannot edit it. So it's essential that you carefully review the article we send you and that you only provide us with articles that are ready to publish.
      <br /><br />
      If you need changes after an article is published, it will cost $150 to remove all the live publications and an additional $195 to republish the article. This process takes about one week to complete. Just contact us if you would like us to do this for you.`,

      question:
        "Will my article be published on the main sites of FOX, USA Today, etc?",
      answer: `For major news sites such as FOX and USA Today you will not be published to the national website such as fox.com as they are restricted for national news headlines.
    <br /><br />
    But you will still be published to local affiliates, including FOX 40 and FOX 34, the official sites for the local TV stations, and other influential news sites that collectively get over 100 million visitors per month.`,

    {
      question: "Can I check the article before its published?",
      answer: `Yes, once our expert writers have completed your article, we send it to you for review. The premium plan gets two rounds of revisions, and the elite plan can have unlimited revisions.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will each news site receive a different article?",
      answer: `All of our plans are to publish a single article on all 200+ news sites.
      <br /><br />
      Publishing a single article is still great for SEO because, unlike blogs, news sites constantly post the same content. Search engines are very aware of this, so you will not have any problem with article uniqueness when publishing duplicate content on news sites. But you will still get all the benefits of having your article and backlinks on high authority websites.
      <br /><br />
      Our customers constantly report back significant boosts in their rank on search engines after just a few weeks of receiving their order report.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will publications be labeled as sponsored content?",
      answer: `News sites such as Digital Journal, Benzinga, and AZ Central do not show any "sponsored content" or "advertisement" labels, making them excellent for sharing and use during social media verification.
      <br /><br />
      Other sites like Market Watch and Fox include a notice that a third party wrote the publication, and some news sites may add a subtle "sponsored content" or "advertisement" label if required by local law.`,
